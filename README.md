## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

Some challenges I faced were finding the buttons described in the walkthrough. For example, when I was told to "Click on the Adjust Editor Options button on the top right of Xcode," it was at the top right, but there were also 3 additional buttons in that corner, so I just had to click and try to find the right one for about 1 minute.
